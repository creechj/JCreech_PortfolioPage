# Jordan Creech Full-Stack Portfolio Page

## Description

This is the full-stack portfolio of Jordan Creech. It utilizes a simple, stream-lined layout to display a few sample projects, a short bio for Jordan, and links to Jordan's email, GitHub, and LinkedIn profile.

## Usage

This site serves as a portfolio of projects collected as examples of technical competencies for future employers to view.  

It will also be a continuous work-in-progress itself, providing a test stage for implementing new development skills as I learn them.
 
Project images are displayed in the main content area of the page and can be clicked to follow links to each deployed project.  

Image captions can be expanded for text elaborating on the details of each.

The site can be viewed at: https://creechj.github.io/JCreech_PortfolioPage/
